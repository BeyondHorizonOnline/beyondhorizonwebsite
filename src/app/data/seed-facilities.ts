    summary: `Standard Voran orbital depot that underpins frontier supply chains, storing everything from raw ore to precision VX-grade munitions.`,
    description: `The CXW-2 Depot is the quintessential Voran orbital warehouse, a modular storage hub that quietly keeps entire campaigns alive beyond the Horizon. Arrayed around a reinforced central spine, its pressurized vaults, frozen-lock canisters, and radiation-shielded silos can house everything from unprocessed asteroid ore to VX-grade strike munitions. Automated mag-clamp bays and crane rails shuttle cargo between incoming freighters and outbound task groups with machine precision, overseen by a lean crew and a ruthless scheduling AI that bills every second of dock time. In the early stages of a system’s exploitation, a lone CXW-2 often drifts above a half-built outpost like a promise of prosperity; by the time the grid is fully lit, that same depot has become the quiet heart of the local economy, the place where every crate, every ration, and every shell has passed through at least once.`,

    description: `The VXG-2 Pulse Core is Voran’s standard outpost-scale heart, a compact fusion generator that marks the transition from temporary camp to permanent foothold. Housed in a shock-isolated shell of composite armor, its reaction chambers burn refined isotopes down to whisper-thin waste, feeding stabilized plasma into local grids via superconducting umbilicals. Internally, maintenance corridors wind around humming magnetic bottles and radiant baffles, while exterior conduits snake outward to habitats, factories, and defense grids that depend on its constant output. Pulse Cores are designed to survive everything from seismic surges to orbital debris strikes; if a frontier colony is reduced to rubble, surveyors often find the VXG-2 still ticking over, patiently waiting for new orders. Many settlers joke that you do not truly live on a world until you can see the blue corona of a Pulse Core on the horizon each night.`,

    summary: `A modular orbital factory that turns raw feedstock and schematics into the working machinery of Voran expansion.`,
    description: `The EXF-5 Forge Line is Voran’s workhorse orbital factory, a mid-tier fabrication yard that translates raw feedstock and encrypted schematics into the vehicles and hull components that push the Horizon ever outward. Drone-fed intake chutes swallow ore, alloys, and specialized polymers, routing them through arrays of adaptive printers and precision milling cells suspended in microgravity. Assembly bays line the station’s outer ring, where articulated arms and EX-series drones snap together engine blocks, armor plates, and subassemblies in a ceaseless ballet of sparks and motion. Each Forge Line carries a curated library of sanctioned blueprints; when higher-priority contracts arrive, its control core can reconfigure entire production chains in hours, tearing down old jigs and spinning up new ones without ever going dark. In contested sectors, the sudden signature of an EXF-5 arriving in orbit is often the first quiet sign that Voran has decided this system is worth keeping.`,

From its vaulted command galleries, orbital lanes are taxed, fleets are assigned, and entire planetary economies are modeled, approved, or strangled. Defense platforms nestle against its hull like loyal hounds, while interior promenades offer carefully curated luxury to those whose loyalty has been deemed profitable. In the Beyond Horizon era, Imperial Stations serve as keystones of hard power and soft control alike; a system that hosts one is not simply occupied, it is folded into the imperial ledger and indexed for long-term exploitation.`,

Behind its mirrored viewports lie layered command centers: tactical ops pits tracking every ship and station, strategic war rooms modeling decades-long campaigns, and shareholder galleries where projected profit curves are weighed against casualty projections. Housing for thousands of senior staff, black-ops cadres, and elite security regiments coils around a core of data-vaults and quantum-link nodes, ensuring that orders from this station cut cleanly through the chaos of deep-space war. Its gun decks and heavy shield grids make the Headquarters a formidable fortress in its own right, but its true power is administrative: the right directive from BX-0 can reroute fleets, extinguish colonies, or greenlight the birth of new cities with a single authorization code.`,

Dropped in modular sections from orbit and auto-assembled by EX drones, a BX-1 can be operational within days of landfall, projecting a secure perimeter of garrisons, comm relays, and landing pads into otherwise lawless terrain. Its command relay core ties local operations into the wider Voran network, while small but efficient warehouses and fuel farms sustain initial mining crews, survey teams, and security detachments. Many thriving Horizon cities began as nothing more than a single BX-1 squatting in the dust, its floodlights cutting through alien night while the first settlers huddled inside. Long after those cities have grown past the walls of the original outpost, the BX-1’s command spire often remains at their center, a reminder of who came first.`,

Its armored tanks and pressurized bins are designed to accept whatever the frontier can provide: bulk ore, harvested volatiles, agricultural surpluses, even seized contraband awaiting corporate appraisal. Basic mag-lift gantries and shuttle pads keep loaders and DRX haulers cycling through at all hours, feeding upstream depots and Forge Lines with a steady flow of material. For many young settlements, the arrival of a CXW-1 is the first clear sign that they have been noticed by the larger machine; once Voran is willing to stockpile your output, you are no longer a rumor at the edge of the map, but a node in the network.`,

Its low-profile bastions and prefabricated modules blend into rough terrain, housing a streamlined command staff, security detachments, and essential support crews. From this foothold, Voran surveyors chart resource veins, negotiate or coerce local polities, and determine whether a full-scale expansion is justified. Though its footprint is modest, the base’s comm tower punches far above its weight, linking even remote colonies to corporate channels and, when necessary, summoning reinforcements from across the grid. To frontier populations, the arrival of a Base.Small is a quiet ultimatum: Voran has noticed your world and is deciding what, exactly, to do with it.`,

Many colonies owe their survival to a single Generator.P that never quite failed—its steady output keeping perimeter shields active as raiders tested their luck or as native storms clawed at fragile domes.

In times of crisis, a single EXF-3 can flood a contested world with mechanized regiments, replacing losses faster than most enemies can destroy them.

Layered defense rings bristle with point-defense grids, capital-grade guns, and interceptor launch cradles, ensuring that any hostile approach must first survive a gauntlet of overlapping fire. Deeper within, cavernous production bays and refinery stacks allow the Citadel to fabricate ships, weapons, and station modules on a scale rivaling dedicated industrial worlds. Docking arms extend like the branches of a cold metal tree, hosting everything from VX battle lines to merchant convoys eager for corporate contracts. Civilian districts, research enclaves, and executive towers spiral around its central axis, making the Citadel not merely a base, but a mobile capital in its own right. In the Beyond Horizon chronicles, sectors that host a BX-9 do not simply belong to Voran—they orbit it, politically and literally.`,

    summary: `A colossal interstellar-class megaforge whose output shapes entire campaigns and redraws strategic maps.`,
    description: `The EXF-9 Titan Forge is the apex of Voran industrial might, an interstellar-class manufacturing complex whose reactors burn so hot that their containment fields glow like captive suns. Stretching for kilometers, the Forge’s segmented superstructure houses layered banks of nanofabricators, capital hull slipways, and materials refineries that operate in perfect concert. Raw resources from DRX fleets flow into its hungry maw and emerge as VX warships, armored stations, and entire modular cities ready for deployment. Internal traffic corridors are busy enough to mimic the skies of a minor world—tugs, drones, and EX frames weaving between titanic assemblies suspended in zero-G. To campaign planners, gaining an EXF-9 in theater is like adding a new planet to their roster; to their enemies, the sudden spike in VX hull production attached to a Titan Forge’s signature is often the first and last warning that the balance of power has shifted irrevocably.`,

    summary: `A massive jump-gate complex that bends subspace into corridors, stitching distant Horizon-frontier sectors into a single contested web.`,
    description: `The BXG-12 Event Horizon is one of the most revered and feared constructs in the Beyond Horizon setting: a superluminal transit gate that makes the impossible distance between stars feel almost trivial—and therefore exploitable. Its vast ring structure is laced with exotic matter conduits and gravitic lensing nodes, all orchestrated by navigation arrays so sophisticated they are classified as strategic assets on par with dreadnoughts. When activated, the gate\'s core blooms with unstable geometries, folding local space into a carefully tuned tunnel that links to a paired Horizon node light-years away. Only ships with certified, military-grade nav-stacks are permitted to ride these corridors; an error in alignment does not mean a simple misjump, but the kind of catastrophic disassembly that never leaves wreckage. Entire campaigns swing on control of a single BXG-12, and wars have been fought not to destroy one, but simply to decide whose fleets are allowed to pass through its shimmering threshold.`,

    description: `The Town Center is the civic heart of a Beyond Horizon settlement, a compact governance hub where Voran oversight and local culture uneasily coexist. On the surface, it presents as a public-friendly plaza complex: administrative offices, arbitration chambers, permit counters, and public forums clustered around a central tower whose windows look out over the growing city. Beneath this accessible façade lies the true machinery of control—data routers that feed citizen metrics to corporate analysts, security coordination rooms that can lock down city districts in minutes, and discreet liaison suites where deals are struck far from public sight. Festivals, protests, and recruitment drives all spiral around the Town Center’s plazas, making it both stage and backdrop for a colony’s social evolution. For many settlers, this is the first Voran-built structure they enter that does not feel like a fortress or a factory, and that, of course, is entirely by design.`,

    summary: `A modular vertical arcology that stacks hundreds of frontier lives into a single glittering spire.`,
    description: `The HX-1 Habspire is Voran’s answer to the eternal frontier problem of space: there is never enough of it where people want to live. Rising like a glass-and-steel needle from the dust, each Habspire contains tiered residential decks, communal markets, recreation rings, and essential life-support systems wrapped around a central services shaft. Apartments range from cramped share-blocks for contract workers to penthouse suites for local executives, all sharing the same air, water loops, and view of the alien sky beyond. Smart walls and configurable interiors allow units to be re-partitioned as demographics shift, while embedded security nodes quietly monitor traffic and behavior. At night, a colony skyline dotted with Habspires becomes a constellation of human persistence, each tower a vertical village clinging to Voran’s promise of stability at the edge of the unknown.`,

    summary: `A high-tier research node where Horizon-era technologies are conceived, tested, and quietly weaponized.`,
    description: `The RX-1 Tech Lab is an advanced research enclave, a cluster of sealed wings and humming reactors where Voran’s brightest minds and most ambitious algorithms push the boundaries of what is possible in the Horizon era. Laboratory tiers are dedicated to distinct disciplines: shield harmonics, drive optimization, neuro-interface design, exotic materials, and the quieter arts of information warfare. Behind opaque glass and security fields, prototypes cycle from raw concept to field-ready hardware, with failures quietly vented into the void or entombed in shielded vaults. Employment here is coveted and dangerous; researchers enjoy privileged housing and access to cutting-edge augmentations, but are bound by deep nondisclosure stacks and the knowledge that some of their work will never see civilian application. In the tapestry of Beyond Horizon lore, the Tech Labs are the hidden forges where tomorrow’s miracle breakthroughs and tomorrow’s atrocities are often born in the same experiment.`,
