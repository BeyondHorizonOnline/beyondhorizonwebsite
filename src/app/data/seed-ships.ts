Its hull is forged from compressed tritanium composites that grant exceptional structural integrity without compromising profile or maneuverability. The Onyx typically takes up position at the center of Voran battle groups, anchoring formations and holding the line where lesser ships would crack. Precision gunnery suites favor accurate, sustained fire over dramatic alpha strikes, slowly and methodically dismantling whatever dares to close. In the tumult of Beyond Horizon engagements, Onyx crews pride themselves on a simple creed: when the dust settles and the wreckage cools, the Onyx will still be there "" shields dimmed, guns cycling, waiting for the next order.`,

    description: 'The VX-6C Vulcan is a heat-borne nightmare, powered by twin plasma cores that transform the vessel into a forward-thrust furnace. Those cores feed massive cannon arrays along the ship\'s prow, each shot disgorging focused thermal lances capable of burning through capital-grade armor in seconds. Thermal bleed is captured and redirected through secondary emitters, turning even the Vulcan\'s waste heat into a short-range hazard for anything reckless enough to close. When it opens fire in earnest, ships on the receiving end report sensor feeds dissolving into white, hull plating bubbling away, and the sudden, horrid realization that space itself seems to be burning. In the Beyond Horizon record, systems scarred by Vulcan bombardments are easy to recognize: their orbital lanes glitter with glassed debris.',

    description: 'The VX-6D Helios wields light itself as a weapon, coupling a solar-fusion drive with high-energy focusing lenses to project radiant lances across orbital distances. Its reactors feed artificial micro-stars that are then shaped and released as coherent beams, slicing through warships, defense grids, and hardened bunkers with surgical finality. Because its primary weapons favor extreme range and line-of-sight corridors, Helios captains often operate from the periphery of engagements, acting as celestial executioners while VX frigates and destroyers herd targets into clean firing arcs. Even when idle, the vessel\'s lens arrays glow with caged radiance, earning it a reputation as a second sun hanging in hostile skies. On worlds touched by the Beyond Horizon conflict, the phrase "Daylight is here" carries a new, uneasy meaning "" it might simply mean a Helios has taken station overhead.',
