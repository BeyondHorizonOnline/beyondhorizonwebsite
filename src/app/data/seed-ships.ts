Its target-tracking AI suite specializes in pattern recognition, identifying likely command hulls, coordination nodes, and fallback routes even as the battle unfolds. Once marked, those targets rarely survive past the third firing solution. The Nemesis rarely leads charges; instead, it appears on the flank or at the edge of the grid, quietly tearing out the brain and spine of an opposing force. In the Beyond Horizon conflicts, admirals learned to fear not the ships they could see, but the Nemesis they could not yet locate.`,

Armored flight decks double as bombardment platforms, mounting heavy batteries that soften planetary and orbital defenses ahead of atmospheric insertions. In Voran doctrine, a Warlord is the heart of any major offensive push, pumping out wave after wave of sorties until local resistance collapses. Throughout the Beyond Horizon campaigns, the sudden arrival of a Warlord in high orbit often marked the moment a regional dispute escalated into a full-scale war.`,

EX-3 Spanner drones swarm over damaged hulls under the Atlas Prime\'s direction, knitting armor, replacing modules, and recharging shield lattices without the need for a friendly port. Entire strike groups have survived grueling Beyond Horizon campaigns solely because an Atlas Prime remained intact, quietly turning wrecks back into warships between jumps.

At close range, point-defense storms and interceptor meshes turn the surrounding volume into a kill box where hostile missiles and strike craft rarely survive more than a few seconds.

Advanced fire-control networks allow the Tyrant to orchestrate overlapping fields of fire, turning a loose formation into a precise, merciless machine.

Thermal bleed is captured and redirected through secondary emitters, turning even the Vulcan\'s waste heat into a short-range hazard for anything reckless enough to close. When it opens fire in earnest, ships on the receiving end report sensor feeds dissolving into white, hull plating bubbling away, and the sudden, horrid realization that space itself seems to be burning.

Because its primary weapons favor extreme range and line-of-sight corridors, Helios captains often operate from the periphery of engagements, acting as celestial executioners while VX frigates and destroyers herd targets into clean firing arcs.
