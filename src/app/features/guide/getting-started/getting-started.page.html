          </div>
          <p>
            Align with one of three rival factions, each with unique ship designs, strategic advantages,
            and lore. Your faction choice affects your starting location, available ships, and diplomacy
            with other players.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't worry too much about this choice — you can interact with all factions throughout
            the game, and faction allegiance can shift over time based on your actions.

            Every captain needs ships. Start with smaller vessels like Frigates and Corvettes,

          </p>
          <p>
            Each ship class serves a different tactical role. A balanced fleet includes scouts,
            combat vessels, and support ships.
