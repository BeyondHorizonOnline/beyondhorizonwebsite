        <p>The Voran Interstellar Exchange — <strong>VIX</strong> — is the galaxy's centralized marketplace where commanders buy, sell, and auction their ships. Backed by Voran Industrial's vast network of Imperial Stations, VIX offers secure transactions, automated logistics, and a trading experience worthy of the galaxy's finest commanders.</p>
        <p>Whether you're looking to offload surplus ships from your fleet, hunt for a deal on a next-tier destroyer, or build a custom squadron through bundle auctions, VIX is your command center for galactic commerce.</p>
        <p>VIX is in addition to the player-run trade base system but it provides a streamlined, empire-backed exchange that handles everything from escrow to delivery.</p>

            <h3>For Sellers</h3>
            <p class="card-lead">List your ships in minutes.</p>
            <ol class="step-list">
              <li><strong>Select Ships</strong> — Choose one ship or multiple ships to create a squadron bundle. Any ship in your fleet can be listed.</li>
              <li><strong>Set Your Price</strong> — Choose a starting bid and optionally set a Buy It Now price for instant sales. Prices must fall within fair market guardrails (minimum 25% of build cost, maximum 5x build cost).</li>
              <li><strong>Choose Duration</strong> — Pick how long your auction runs: 1 hour, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, or up to 24 hours.</li>
              <li><strong>Voran Handles the Rest</strong> — Once you confirm your listing, Voran dispatches an invulnerable carrier to transport your ships to the nearest Imperial Station. Your listing goes live the moment they arrive.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>When your ship sells, Voran deposits the proceeds directly into your account (minus a small broker fee). It's that simple.</p>

            <ol class="step-list">
              <li><strong>Browse & Search</strong> — Filter by ship type, tech tier, price range, and more. Watch auctions that catch your eye.</li>
              <li><strong>Bid Smart</strong> — VIX uses a proxy bidding system. Set your maximum bid and VIX automatically bids on your behalf, only going as high as needed to stay in the lead. Your maximum bid is never revealed to other players.</li>
              <li><strong>Or Buy It Now</strong> — See something you must have? Hit Buy It Now for an instant purchase (available only before the first bid is placed).</li>
              <li><strong>Delivery on Your Terms</strong> — Won an auction? Tell Voran where to deliver. Choose your system, your base, or even a specific planet for ground units. Voran's carriers handle the rest, and you can track your delivery in real-time.</li>

      <h2 class="section-title">What Makes VIX Different</h2>

      <div class="feature-grid">
        <div class="feature-card">
          <h4>Proxy Bidding</h4>
          <p>Set your max and walk away. VIX bids for you automatically, keeping you in the lead without overpaying. Your maximum bid stays secret.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
          <h4>Squadron Bundles</h4>
          <p>Sell entire fleets as a package deal. Bundle any combination of ships into a single listing — fighters, frigates, capital ships, you name it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
          <h4>Secure Escrow</h4>
          <p>Every bid is backed by real credits. When you bid, your credits are held safely in escrow. If you're outbid, they're returned instantly. No more worrying about buyers who can't pay.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
          <h4>Anti-Snipe Protection</h4>
          <p>No more last-second steals. If a bid is placed in the final seconds of an auction, the timer automatically extends by one minute, giving everyone a fair chance to respond.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
          <h4>Real-Time Tracking</h4>
          <p>Watch your ships travel across the galaxy. From the moment a Voran carrier picks up your purchase to the moment it docks at your base, you can track every jump in real-time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
          <h4>Seller Ratings</h4>
          <p>Build your reputation. After every completed sale, buyers can rate their experience. Top-rated sellers earn trust — and more bids.</p>

            <p>Starting bids cannot be set below 25% of a ship's build cost, and Buy It Now prices cannot exceed 5x the build cost. This prevents both dumping and price gouging.</p>
